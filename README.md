# android-testing
A Android test project for testing different Android APIes, patterns, libraries and frameworks

# Warning
The code here will often be hastily written and is meant for trying out Android APIes, libraries and frameworks. The code will not often, if ever, be "clean" or "best practice".

That being said you might find many useful POC implementations here that you are free to check out and try yourself
